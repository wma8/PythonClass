    "We will use Tkinter to design GUIs. Let's start with a few basics of Tkinter. This is a module that lets us open a window which may contain canvasses, labels, buttons, which the user is allowed to interact with, without using python code. We do this by binding “events” such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses to functions. Different types of events have different attributes. For example, a left mouse-click on a canvas has attributes x and y, corresponding to the coordinates of the cursor at the time of click. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, the __Tk( )__ class creates the basic GUI object. Then we create a Canvas object and add it to the GUI with the __pack( )__ command. Finally, we __bind__ the mouseclick to the creation of a rectangle, of which the upper left corner is at the position of the cursor. The __mainloop( )__ command launches the GUI."
