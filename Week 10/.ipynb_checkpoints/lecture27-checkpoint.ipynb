    "In this lecture, we practice sending data back and forth between two computers/consoles. This can be useful for many applications. We use the socket object, which holds a connection. The two machines that are communicating are called the __server__ and the __client__. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose the main difference between the two is that the client initializes the connection (makes the phone call, as it were), and the server accepts it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection uses the IP address of the server (127.0.0.1 if the client and server are on the same machine) and a port number. The port number allows there to be multiple connections to the same machine. The port number is chosen by the user, and may be any integer > 1024. \n",
    "\n",
    "The server uses commands such as \n",
    "- __bind__, which binds a port number to a socket, \n",
    "- __listen__, which means waiting for incoming connections, and \n",
    "- __accept__, which tells it to accept an incoming connection request from a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client uses the command \n",
    "- __connect__ to try to initialize a connection with a server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the server and the client can \n",
    "- __send__ a message, \n",
    "- __recv__, receive a message, and \n",
    "- __close__ the connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get started is to look at the example given in the python documentation https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html (example 17.2.2) and start adapting the example.\n"

Also, note that we send as little information back and forth as possible, since sending and receiving take a lot of time. "
