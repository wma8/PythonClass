It is almost always impossible to write $M$ as a factor of two such matrices, because this is a simplification (and potentially noise reduction) of the data. Therefore, we find two matrices such that the product is “as close as possible” to the original matrix. This is done by minimizing the L2-norm (square root of the sum of squares of all the elements) of the difference matrix. \n",

This method is extremely powerful, because we can use only partial data from $M$ to approximate $W$ and $H$. For example, we do not need to use all of the movies (columns) to approximate $W$, or all of the users to approximate $H$. Intuitively, you can guess quite well what kind of movie fan somebody is (and predict how much they will like new movies) by knowing how they have rated some number of past movies. You do not need to know how they have rated all movies in the history of film making."
