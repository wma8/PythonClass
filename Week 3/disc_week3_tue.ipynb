    "Make sure to test each variant on inputs `n=0`, `n=1`, and `n=5` (note: `5! = 120`). Then, use the following *magic* ([`%%timeit`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit) is an IPython magic; a special syntax that IPython interprets) to see how fast each variant is."

You can build a list of primes from 2 to N faster than you can test every number from 2 to N for primality (because you can use your list to speed things up, even while the list is incomplete). A reasonably well-known and reasonably fast algorithm is the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). (There's no good reason to memorize this algorithm, but it's good practice to implement it from pseudocode.)"

    "    \n",
    "3. `compose(f, g)`: Return a function, that returns `f(g(x))` when called on an object `x`. Assume that both `f` and `g` take a single argument and return a single value. Here's the multi-line version. The one-liner requires that your write a lambda expression.\n",

    "    \n",
    "6. `dict_to_lines(d)`: Return a multi-line string, where each line is of the form `k => d[k]` for a key `k` in `d`. Hint: [`str.join()`](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=substr#str.join)"
